A Graph Theoretic Approach to Puzzle Solving	
In this study, we examine the puzzle "Instant Insanity" which
consists of four cubes with each of their six faces colored red,
blue, green, and yellow. The aim of the puzzle is to stack these
cubes in a column so that each side (front, back, left, and right) of
the stack shows each of the four colors. We will illustrate how to
figure out a possible solution by graph theoretic means.

#Let the games begin….	
The game of the four colored cubes consists of four cubes, each
of whose sides is colored with one of four colors. The object of
the game is to place the cubes next to each other in such a way
that each of the long sides of the rectangular solid obtained has
all four colors appearing on it. The game has been in existence
since at least the 1940s, when it was sold commercially under the
name “Tantalizer”, and more recently as the popular puzzle
“Instant Insanity”. There are 41,472 number of ways to do this so
finding a solution is difficult.	
We used graph theory to solve this game. Here is an example.
